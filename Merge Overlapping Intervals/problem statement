You are given an array of intervals - that is, an array of tuples (start, end). The array may not be sorted, and could contain overlapping intervals. Return another array where the overlapping intervals are merged.

For example:
[(1, 3), (5, 8), (4, 10), (20, 25)]

This input should return [(1, 3), (4, 10), (20, 25)] since (5, 8) and (4, 10) can be merged into (4, 10).

Here's a starting point:

def merge(intervals):
  # Fill this in.
  
print merge([(1, 3), (5, 8), (4, 10), (20, 25)])
# [(1, 3), (4, 10), (20, 25)]
