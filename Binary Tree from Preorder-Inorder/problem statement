You are given the preorder and inorder traversals of a binary tree in the form of arrays. Write a function that reconstructs the tree represented by these traversals.

Example:
Preorder: [a, b, d, e, c, f, g]
Inorder: [d, b, e, a, f, c, g]

The tree that should be constructed from these traversals is:

    a
   / \
  b   c
 / \ / \
d  e f  g
