You are given a string of parenthesis. Return the minimum number of parenthesis that would need to be removed in order to make the string valid. "Valid" means that each open parenthesis has a matching closed parenthesis.

Example:

"()())()"

The following input should return 1.

Here's a start:

def count_invalid_parenthesis(string):
  # Fill this in.

print count_invalid_parenthesis("()())()")
# 1
